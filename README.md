   Creating a weather application is a popular and practical way to explore API integrations, data parsing, and dynamic user interface design. Task 2 involves building a weather app using WeatherAPI’s current weather endpoint, accessible via:

https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=API_KEY&q=${city}

To implement this task, developers typically use React.js for the frontend. React allows building a clean, interactive UI where users can enter a city name and instantly retrieve weather data without needing page reloads. Its component-based structure makes it easy to divide the UI into sections like a search bar, result display, and error messages.

The developer first obtains an API key from WeatherAPI.com, registering for a free or paid account depending on data volume needs. The API responds with JSON data containing details like temperature, humidity, weather descriptions, wind speed, and weather icons. This API is robust, supporting real-time weather, forecasts, and historical data for thousands of global cities.

The application uses tools like Fetch API or Axios to send HTTP requests from the React frontend to the WeatherAPI endpoint. The developer captures user input via forms and constructs the API request URL dynamically based on the city entered. Once the API response arrives, the data is stored in React’s state and displayed on the UI.

For styling, developers often use CSS, **Bootstrap, or libraries like **Material-UI to enhance visual appeal. Features might include animated icons, weather graphs, and color changes based on temperature or weather conditions. Error handling is critical — the app should gracefully inform users if a city is not found, the API key is invalid, or the network is unavailable.

The development environment typically involves running the app locally using tools like npm and Create React App, but final deployment might be on platforms such as **Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify, which provide quick deployment pipelines for React applications.

Weather apps serve numerous practical purposes. They’re integrated into travel planning apps, agricultural dashboards, event planning tools, and smart home systems. For example, farmers rely on weather forecasts for irrigation planning, while travelers check conditions before trips. These applications can also integrate with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.

Building a weather app provides valuable experience in working with third-party APIs, handling asynchronous data fetching, managing API rate limits, and creating user-friendly interfaces. It also emphasizes best practices like protecting API keys via environment variables and ensuring responsive design for different screen sizes.

Overall, this task offers a real-world, user-focused project, combining technical skills with a practical utility that demonstrates a developer’s ability to integrate external services into modern web applications.
